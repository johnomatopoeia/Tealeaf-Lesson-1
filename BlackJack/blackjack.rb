## Daniel I think the color really pops, and I am impressed with your design.  
#I totally spent an hour trying to figure out how to use the ansi suits, and gave up without trying the simple solution.
#I have since borrowed your method.  I did have trouble following everything that was going during gameplay, but
#that is probably because I am lazy and didn't want to read to much.  -JZ
